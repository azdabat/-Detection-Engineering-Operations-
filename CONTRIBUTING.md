# Contributing Guidelines

This repository is structured as a production detection engineering program.

All contributions must follow:

- Behaviour-first truth anchoring
- Composite reinforcement logic
- Noise suppression discipline
- SOC-ready analyst directives

---

## Contribution Rules

Every detection must include:

- Minimum Truth anchor
- Reinforcement joins
- Scoring + severity output
- Noise suppression gates
- MITRE mapping

---

## Rule Submission Process

1. Develop in POC folder first
2. Validate telemetry + schema
3. Apply QA checklist
4. Pass promotion gates
5. Merge into production composites

---

This ensures the repository remains operationally deployable.
