# Detection Engineering Roadmap (2026)

This roadmap defines the strategic buildout of attack ecosystem coverage.

Focus: High-fidelity behavioural composites.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Enterprise Attack Chains (Complete)

- SMB lateral movement via services.exe
- OAuth consent + token misuse ecosystem
- Scheduled Task execution primitives

Status:  Production-grade Tier-3 composites

---

## Phase 2 — Advanced Persistence & Execution (In Progress)

- Silent TaskCache persistence
- WMI event subscription ecosystems
- IFEO / COM hijack chains

Status:  Tier-2 composite maturity

---

## Phase 3 — Command & Control Ecosystems (2026 Focus)

C2 is highest-noise and highest-value.

Planned composites:

- Named Pipe C2 + lateral convergence
- HTTPS jitter beacon detection
- Blockchain RPC EtherRAT tradecraft
- Cloudflare/CDN abuse C2 variants

Status: POC staging

---

## Phase 4 — Full Detection-as-Code Function

- CI/CD promotion gates automated
- Regression testing harness
- Release tagging + managed lifecycle
- SOC engineering ownership model

Target: Tier-4 Managed Detection Program

---

Detection is not rule writing.

It is attack-architecture coverage over time.
