# Detection Engineering Operating Model

This repository represents a modern SOC Detection Engineering function.

---

## Core Principles

- Behaviour over indicators
- Composite convergence over single alerts
- Structural suppression over allowlist spam
- Scoring over binary triggers
- Analyst directives embedded by design

---

## Function Ownership

Detection engineering owns:

- rule quality
- lifecycle maturity
- SOC usability
- continuous tuning
- threat tradecraft translation

---

## Outcome

A detection program that produces:

- high-fidelity alerts
- scalable hunting logic
- operational SOC impact
- resilient behavioural coverage

---

Detection Engineering is defensive architecture.
